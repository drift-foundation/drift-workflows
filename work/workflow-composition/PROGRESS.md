# Workflow Composition — Progress

## Status

Release is cut + announced. Design at `DESIGN.md` is at **rev 3** (preflight re-slice + K review rounds folded
in). **Decision #1
(transport) RESOLVED → internal durable host API, async + awaited** — a workflow call is a pending **call
operation**; the parent stays in normal forward execution, and a blocked child does **not** cascade up the
call tree. **Decision #2 (slice plan) RE-SLICED by preflight** — 1a frontend-only, 1b forward spine (no
compensation runtime), 1c compensation. Terminology fixed (workflow call / child workflow / call operation;
avoid "callback").

**Slice plan (re-sliced by preflight):**
- **Slice 1a** — frontend only (no DB/runtime): grammar + IR `NCallWorkflow` + contract validation + **static
  cycle check** + mermaid. Parses `compensation` but **build-rejects it until 1c** (never accept-and-ignore).
- **Slice 1b** — forward async-call spine, **no compensation runtime**: sidecar `tb_mf_call` + `call_kind`;
  `call_submit` / `call_inspect` (authoritative child read) / `child_terminal_notify` (wake + status-hint
  only) / settle / recovery / recursion-guard. No-comp reversal = no-op. **Minimal inspectability**
  (`child_workflow_id` + `child_status` so operators follow A→B→C). **No blocked cascade.**
- **Slice 1c** — compensation path: reconsider compensating-workflow vs reverse-child/T1, then ship one.
- **Slice 2** — stuck-child liveness budget (standalone). **Slice 3** — fan-out + `on failed`-as-data.

The per-slice **build checklists** (1a/1b/1c) are in `DESIGN.md`.

**Design-review pass folded in (5 findings):** (1) the runtime **recursion guard** now keys on the
**ancestor SET of plan-identity keys** `(script_name, plan_version, content_hash)` — child ids are freshly
derived per call, so an instance-id ancestor check can't catch an A→B→A cycle; plus `max_call_depth`. The key
needs **no new workflow column** (`content_hash`/`plan_version` are already in `tb_mf_workflow_plan`).
(2) The **call-operation storage model** is now concrete: `operation_id = child_workflow_id`;
`schema_version`/`status`/`result_json` keep their existing meaning + invariant (NOT overloaded with the
child plan revision); child plan identity lives in call-specific columns `child_script_name` /
`child_plan_version` / `child_content_hash`; `sp_mf_call_submit` is a **sibling** of
`sp_mf_operation_request` (not a caller). (3) `child_terminal_notify` is **wake/stage-only** — the runner +
`call_inspect` is the single authoritative settle/reversal. (4)/(5) Stale open-decision sections retired and
the durable-state sketch marked slice-neutral (liveness columns = slice 2).

**Second review round folded in (storage/identity hardening):** (1) **`call <child>@<plan_version>`** is now
explicit — `@` is a **semantic plan version** (`major.minor.patch`), registry-resolved by exact-match to the
pinned `content_hash` (the same plan-pin model as a top-level workflow); not an opaque alias, not a
participant `schema_version`. (2) The call op's **`operation_name = child_script_name`** (no prefix → no `varchar(128)`
overflow; **`call_kind`** is the discriminator; `sp_mf_operation_settle` copies it into the checkpoint, so
it is the compensation envelope's `forward.operation`). The call op's `schema_version` is a named constant
**`CALL_OPERATION_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`**, and the comp **`{forward:{…}}`** envelope carries the full
correlation set (`workflow_id`, `operation`, **`operation_id = child_workflow_id`**, `schema_version`,
`input`, `result`). Liveness is **split**: slice 1b ships terminal push + poll fallback; the stuck-child
budget is slice 2 (standalone). (3) The compensation workflow is pinned by its **exact plan identity** (`comp_script_name`
/ `comp_plan_version` / `comp_content_hash`), mirroring the checkpoint's `reverse_operation_name`+
`reverse_schema_version` pin — not a loose `name@rev`. (4) The recursion ancestor set is **reconstructed by
walking `parent_workflow_id` links + joining `tb_mf_workflow_plan`** (bounded by `call_depth`) — no
denormalized ancestor column. (5) Doc title aligned with this index.

**Preflight architecture review folded in (complexity-containment + reliability lens).** Five structural
changes before any parser code: (1) **Re-sliced** to 1a (frontend) / 1b (forward spine) / 1c (compensation) —
because compensating-workflow in slice 1 hid a *second* async-call-await/settle/recovery engine, not obviously
simpler than reverse-child/T1. (2) **Slice 1 runtime is NO-COMP only**; 1a parses `compensation` but **build
validation rejects it** until 1c (never accept-and-ignore). (3) **Minimal inspectability in 1b** — the parent
call op exposes `child_workflow_id` + last `child_status` so operators follow A→B→C by hand (no blocked
cascade). (4) **Notify is wake + status-hint ONLY** — no `child_return_json` value-of-record; `call_inspect`
re-reads the child's authoritative terminal at settle; **poll is the floor**, correctness never depends on
notify (also makes a future T1 reopen safe). (5) **Sidecar `tb_mf_call`** holds all composition state;
`tb_mf_operation` gains only the `call_kind` discriminator (don't widen the hot op table). Also recorded: the
**app-boundary lens** — the service may take the complexity, but business apps/participants/authors must never
handle plan hashes, parent links, leases/fences, notify/poll mechanics, or checkpoint state.

## Current Scope

Design complete (`DESIGN.md`); **slice 1a (frontend only — no DB, no runtime) is the active build scope.**
Overall feature:

- any workflow step may be a child workflow;
- child workflow owns its own durable state;
- parent treats the child call as one forward step/checkpoint with result data flow;
- compensations may be workflows;
- dynamic fan-out uses stable child workflow ids, not operation occurrence indexes.

## Verification

**Slice 1a frontend core — IMPLEMENTED + verified (registry-free part).**
- `parser.drift`: `[let x =] call <child>@<plan_version> { <input> } [compensation <wf>@<plan_version>]`
  parsed → `KCall` AST → lowered to a `call` graph node; `@<plan_version>` is a `maj.min.patch` token;
  `on failed` / `fan` rejected as "not in this release".
- `ir.drift`: `NCallWorkflow` node (+`CallComp`) — `parse_graph` branch, canonical (`W` tag, hashes the
  compensation), mermaid, `_succs`/`_node_id`/`_check_node` arms, `advance` defensive-fault (no 1a runtime),
  `EResult` may now reference a call node, and `validate_graph` **build-rejects `compensation`** until 1c.
- Compiles clean (standalone `driftc` over `parser.drift`+`ir.drift`); a smoke driver passes (valid call ok;
  compensation rejected; `on failed`/`fan`/bad-version/non-object-input all parse-rejected).
- 7 new `--parse-check` fixtures + goldens under `runner/tests/fixtures/parser/check/` (`call_single`,
  `call_bare`, `call_compensation_rejected`, `err_call_{on_failed,fan,bad_version,no_input}`).
- **No regression:** a faithful standalone `_parse_check` replica reproduced all **88** existing check
  goldens byte-for-byte. `ir_graph_test` passes. (Full runner binary + `run_parser_fixtures.py` gate can't
  build locally — missing external deps; runs in CI.)

**Remaining for 1a (manifest-backed — needs full build env, not testable locally):** child `name@version`
registry resolution + input↔child-`arg` / downstream↔child-`return` contract match, and the **static
recursion/cycle check** (registry enumerates each pinned plan's `NCallWorkflow` edges). These live in the
`--manifest` path (`runner.drift`), the only place a multi-script workflow registry exists.

## Dirty Worktree

The three work files are committed. Current dirty state:
- **Docs:** `DESIGN.md` + `PROGRESS.md` (design refinements + this status).
- **Code (slice 1a frontend core):** `microflows/runner/src/parser.drift`, `microflows/runner/src/ir.drift`.
- **Tests:** 14 new files under `microflows/runner/tests/fixtures/parser/check/` — 7 `.mf` + 7 `.expected`
  (`call_single`, `call_bare`, `call_compensation_rejected`, `err_call_{on_failed,fan,bad_version,no_input}`).

A reachable `call` is **build-rejected** (op-depth gate) until 1b, so the frontend-only node can never reach
the runtime fault; `--parse-check` still accepts calls. Verified: standalone `parser.drift`+`ir.drift` compile;
smoke driver passes (incl. build-gate); 95 parser-check goldens reproduce (88 existing byte-for-byte + 7 new);
`ir_graph_test` + `ir_exec_test` pass. Full runner binary + fixture gate need the CI build env (deps absent
locally).

## Literal Next Action

**Slice 1a frontend core is implemented + locally verified** (parser + IR + 7 fixtures). Two ways forward:
1. **Land the registry-free 1a frontend increment** — commit `parser.drift` + `ir.drift` + the 14 fixtures
   (+ docs), run the full `just test` gate in a CI/full-build env, then continue.
2. **Continue 1a in a full-build env** — implement the **manifest-backed** validation (task #3): child
   `name@<plan_version>` registry resolution + input↔`arg`/downstream↔`return` contract match + the **static
   recursion/cycle check** (enumerate each pinned plan's `NCallWorkflow` edges). This lives in the `--manifest`
   path (`runner.drift`) and is **not buildable/testable in the current local env** (missing external deps).

Then 1b (forward async-call spine) and 1c (compensation) per the `DESIGN.md` checklists.
